 CALCULATOR
![Calculator Icon](/CalculatorSmall.png)

Calculator will be the default Calculator app for AuruOS

Like most of the other default applications it is written in C++

At the moment it is a very basic calculator,

We will continue to add more to it.

# Install
Calculator will be available pre-installed on AROS, but until then you can install it here!

Firstly, get the code by opening a terminal and typing 
```

I have included an `install.sh` script

Navigate to the code with:

```
cd Calculator
```

run it as root by entering the following command:

```
sudo bash install.sh
```

# Running

There are 3 ways to run the application.

1. Run the calculator application from the terminal. After installing make sure you are still in the `Calculator` directory and type 
```
./calculator
```

2. Run the calculator application from the applications menu.

3. Run the calculator application by clicking the icon on the dekstop. 
``
Note: If it is your first time running the application from the desktop icon, It will appear greyed-out. Before launching you must right-click and select ALLOW LAUNCHING
